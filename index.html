            <h2>What is GIS?</h2>
            <h3>A geographic information system (GIS) is a computer system for capturing, storing, checking, and displaying data related to positions on Earth’s surface. 
                GIS can show many different kinds of data on one map, such as streets, buildings, and vegetation. 
                This enables people to more easily see, analyze, and understand patterns and relationships.</h3>

            <p>Quantum GIS (QGIS) is an open source Geographic Information System (GIS) that implements a large number of geospatial data access, visualization, processing, and analysis functions. 
                It can access vector data stored in a wide variety of formats, including file-based (e.g. ESRI Shape Files, KML, GML), geodatabases (e.g. PostgreSQL/PostGIs, ODBC, ESRI Personal GeoDatabase, SQLlite), and network protocols (OPeNDAP, GeoJSON); raster data in one of over 40 formats supported by the underlying GDAL raster library (including NetCDF, HDF5, GeoTIFF, GRIB, and JPEG-2000); and Open Geospatial Consortium visualization and data access services (Web Map and Web Feature Services [WMS and WFS, respectively]). 
                Depending upon the host system configuration, QGIS can also act as an alternative Graphical User Interface for the large collection of GRASS GIS geospatial processing functions. 
                QGIS includes a "plug-in" architecture in which extensions to the core functionality of the application may be developed and used, with current plug-ins including support for GPS integration, interaction with the OpenStreetMap data servers, and data transformation tools.

            <p>The Feature Manipulation Engine (FME) is a platform that streamlines the translation of spatial data between geometric and digital formats. 
                It is intended especially for use with geographic information system (GIS), computer-aided design (CAD) and raster graphics software. 
                The platform was originally developed by Safe Software, Inc. of Surrey, British Columbia, Canada.
                The FME is useful in applications involving interactive geographical, geological and topographical mapping, such as Google Earth and MapQuest. 
                It facilitates the transformation of spatial data into a variety of formats, data models and repositories for transmission to end users. This process is called spatial extract, transform and load (spatial ETL).

            <p>ArcGIS is a geographical information system (GIS) software that allows handling and analyzing geographic information by visualizing geographical statistics through layer building maps like climate data or trade flows. 
                Unlike QGIS ArcGis is not an open source software, it requires a paid licence to access and operate.
                It’s used by a whole host of academic institutions and departments, both in the humanities and sciences, to develop and illustrate groundbreaking research. Further, it is used by several governments and private/commercial institutions worldwide.
                The system has the capacity to create geographical information accessible throughout a company, institution, privately or publicly on the internet. Therefore, the software essentially works as a platform whereby geographical information can be linked, shared and analyzed.
