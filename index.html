            <h2>What is GIS?</h2>
            <h3>A geographic information system (GIS) is a computer system for capturing, storing, checking, and displaying data related to positions on Earth’s surface. 
                GIS can show many different kinds of data on one map, such as streets, buildings, and vegetation. 
                This enables people to more easily see, analyze, and understand patterns and relationships.</h3>

            <p>Quantum GIS (QGIS) is an open source Geographic Information System (GIS) that implements a large number of geospatial data access, visualization, processing, and analysis functions. 
                It can access vector data stored in a wide variety of formats, including file-based (e.g. ESRI Shape Files, KML, GML), geodatabases (e.g. PostgreSQL/PostGIs, ODBC, ESRI Personal GeoDatabase, SQLlite), and network protocols (OPeNDAP, GeoJSON); raster data in one of over 40 formats supported by the underlying GDAL raster library (including NetCDF, HDF5, GeoTIFF, GRIB, and JPEG-2000); and Open Geospatial Consortium visualization and data access services (Web Map and Web Feature Services [WMS and WFS, respectively]). 
                Depending upon the host system configuration, QGIS can also act as an alternative Graphical User Interface for the large collection of GRASS GIS geospatial processing functions. 
                QGIS includes a "plug-in" architecture in which extensions to the core functionality of the application may be developed and used, with current plug-ins including support for GPS integration, interaction with the OpenStreetMap data servers, and data transformation tools.

            <p>The Feature Manipulation Engine (FME) is a platform that streamlines the translation of spatial data between geometric and digital formats. 
                It is intended especially for use with geographic information system (GIS), computer-aided design (CAD) and raster graphics software. 
                The platform was originally developed by Safe Software, Inc. of Surrey, British Columbia, Canada.
                The FME is useful in applications involving interactive geographical, geological and topographical mapping, such as Google Earth and MapQuest. 
                It facilitates the transformation of spatial data into a variety of formats, data models and repositories for transmission to end users. This process is called spatial extract, transform and load (spatial ETL).

            <p>ArcGIS is a geographical information system (GIS) software that allows handling and analyzing geographic information by visualizing geographical statistics through layer building maps like climate data or trade flows. 
                Unlike QGIS ArcGis is not an open source software, it requires a paid licence to access and operate.
                It’s used by a whole host of academic institutions and departments, both in the humanities and sciences, to develop and illustrate groundbreaking research. Further, it is used by several governments and private/commercial institutions worldwide.
                The system has the capacity to create geographical information accessible throughout a company, institution, privately or publicly on the internet. Therefore, the software essentially works as a platform whereby geographical information can be linked, shared and analyzed.

            <h2>Reasons to use GIS</h2>
                    <h3>Data Capturing</h3>
                    <p>The process of inserting data in a GIS system, in order to analyze and edit it, is the most difficult and time-consuming procedure in the whole GIS software. 
                        The amount of data used to create either a base map or a layer with information placed above the base map is usually enormous. With the evolution of science, however, a new “science” or method we could say better, developed. 
                        This method is called data capturing and is referred in the process of inserting data in a system in an automatic way and not as a direct result of data input, using a different activity or a different software than GIS for example. 
                        Data capturing could be indeed considered as a whole science as it includes many cases of initial sources and forms of documents which urge to insert them in GIS and digitize them.

                        More specifically and with regard to GIS, data capturing is a technology used to insert digital information from various sources. 
                        Even if these sources are in a proportional format, data capturing has the ability to convert them in digital format while entering the GIS system. 
                        It is very important for the user, to know what is the project about, in order to take the right decision about the most appropriate method of data capturing. 
                        Some of these methods may be the conventional scanning which inserts a map on GIS as a raster file, survey data entered by a technique called COGO which is applied in survey devices for digital data collection systems, imagery from satellites, LiDAR etc. 
                        Of course, all the above sources give data in digital format and we shouldn’t forget that there are also originations such as letters, emails, conventional survey instruments which demand human intervention. 
                        This human intervention includes the traditional way of manual digitizing data by georeferencing a scanned image and giving coordinates in the 4 edges of the picture.</p>   
                    <h4>The Main Types of Data Capturing</h4>
                    <h5>Primary data sources:</h5>
                     
                        <li>
                            Raster data capturing is data originated from remote sensing with information about physical, chemical and biological objects on earth. 
                            The data have a spectral, spatial and temporal resolution which means that there are specific characteristics of the final image and an updated image for each repeated cycle of the satellite.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Vector data capturing consists of two branches, ground surveying, and GPS.
                            Ground surveying obtains data for buildings, boundaries, and others with high accuracy, but it is time consuming and an expensive method.
                            GPS includes linear and point location data. The data comes from satellites and lately from a new technology named LiDAR with image data from aircraft using a laser for topographic projects. 
                            GPS also gives us the ability to enter attribute data simultaneously with the data captured.
                        </li>
                        <h5>Secondary data sources:</h5>
                     
                        <li>
                            Scanning of secondary data such as the capturing of raster data from documents, films, paper maps and aerial photographs are scanned in order to reduce decay and to constitute the basis where other layers will be placed on.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Digitizing and vectorization which converts raster data into vector data. Digitizing is a brillaint way view old manuscripts and prserve the real one.
                        </li>
                    <h3>Spatial Analysis</h3>
                    <p>Spatial analysis inevitably concerns itself with a finite region, a small bounded segment of an infinite space. 
                        Because of this finiteness of a study region, a boundary always exists, while any spatial phenomenon such as spatial distribution, association, interaction, and diffusion observed within the study region is most likely to extend beyond its boundary. 
                        In addition, the majority of spatial statistical theories has been developed on the basis of the infinite space assumption. 
                        Therefore, analysis confined within a bounded study region may well be biased because of the ignorance of the outside of the study region as well as the inappropriateness of the theories. 
                        This problem of potential bias in spatial analysis is referred to as edge effects (or boundary effects). Edge effects are important for any type of spatial analysis, including analysis of point and areal data, because methods for spatial analysis always require that spatial relationships between observations be defined based on their proximity, adjacency, or other criteria, which may be biased due to unrecorded observations located outside the study region.

                        For point pattern analysis, there are a variety of analytical methods that are based on inter-point distances. When points distributed outside the study region are ignored, the nearest-neighbor distance for a particular point observed within the study region may be overestimated, which will in turn distort test statistics. 
                        For instance, by applying such methods to a CSR pattern without realizing edge effects, one might falsely conclude that it was a regular pattern because of the longer inter-point distances than expected for CSR.
                        
                        Methods for areal data analysis often take into account neighbors of individual areal units because, for example, a crime rate observed in a particular area in a city tends to be influenced not only by characteristics of the area itself but also by those of its neighborhood. Because areal units lying along the boundary of a study region generally have their neighbors outside the study region too, such areal data analysis methods will also be affected by edge effects. 
                        If those external influences are simply ignored, results of spatial analysis will be less reliable for areal units close to the study-region boundary than for those well inside. The problem of edge effects is often called the boundary value problem in areal data analysis.</p>
