# 1. Introduction
[Go to the top](#table-of-contents)

This is the first website I created and is part of my project portfolio required in the Full-Stack Software Development Diploma I am currently undertaking.
The aim of the website is to show and inform users of the following:
-	The website should explain with GIS
-	The website should identify commonly used tools to build a GIS
-	The website should give examples of industries where GIS can be applied, to improve it
-	The website should provide links to interesting live GIS viewers to demonstrate what can be achieved within a GIS and to provide the user with food for thought.

## How to use
The website can be operated by the following:
###	Header 
The header is a sticky navigation bar which can bring the user to four core sections of the website.
####	Core sections
The four core section are made up of the following:
-	An introduction explaining what GIS is.
-	The “GIS Tools” section has clickable links to varies GIS tools home webpages to show the user some of the tools required to build a GIS. A paragraph beside the link explains what the tool can achieve.
-	The “Where GIS Works” section explains to the user what industry sectors GIS can have a positive impact on when incorporated. 
-	The “Live Maps” section has four clickable links to four different live viewers which gives the user a taste of what possible with GIS.
 
###	Footer
The footer is comprised of two sections:
-	A form section is created to allow the user to register his/her name and email address to receive additional GIS related topics to browse and learn from.
-	The second section in the footer contains links to the following social media websites:
1. Facebook
2. Twitter
3. YouTube
4. Instagram
