# 1. UX
  [Go to the top](#table-of-contents)

Working as a GIS Specialest for a number of years now I increasinly get asked What is GIS? and what exactly do you do for a living?

This tells me there is not that much information out there about GIS so I decided to create an easy to use website detailing how to get started using GIS were one interested in presueing a career in the feild.

This website is also targeted at comapanies that are interested at incorparating GIS into there business.

<a name="strategy"></a>

## Scope

As I am unable to include all of the features from the strategy table. I will phase this project in multiple phases. Phase 1 will be what I have identified as a minimum viable product. Please find below the plans I have for each phase.

### Phase 1
- Add educational content
- Highlight his achievements
- Responsive design
- Increase awareness
- Contact me form
- Career history
- Testimonials

### Phase 2

<a name="structure"></a>
## 1.2. Structure
  [Go to the top](#table-of-contents)

It is really important to include responsive design in this project as many users are using different devices (mobile, tablet, laptop/PC). This gives the user the best experience on their device.

 - Responsive on all devices sizes
 - Navigation bar is placed on the top left of the screen and is clear and easy to use. This is also placed in the same position on every page.
 - Footer at the bottom of each page that links to the social media websites.
 - All elements will be consistent including font size, font family, colour scheme.

<a name="skeleton"></a>
## 1.3. Skeleton
  [Go to the top](#table-of-contents)

I used [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/) to create my wireframes as this gives the template of the UI. This also shows where all elements will be placed within the screen.

There are 2 versions of each wireframe as one shows the design on a web browser and the other shows a mobile browser format.

# 2. Features
  [Go to the top](#table-of-contents)

### All pages:
- Navigation bar is placed at the top of the screen, for ease of use and consistency. It has a hover effect and changes colour to improve the user experience. The page that you have selected also highlights red so the user knows exactly which page they are on.
- Social media links, - all links are placed at the bottom of each page in the footer. All links open in a new tab.
- Logo/text - a Sir Alex Ferguson logo is also placed on the top right of each page. This gives the context that the website is about him.

### Landing page:
- Main image - a large image that shows who the website is about.
- Summary - a summary of what Sir Alex achieved.
- Video - an embedded tribute video from youtube that gives the user the multimedia experience. This helps the user to be engaged with the website.

### Career page:
- Overall statistics - a small bordered box that shows his managerial career stats.
- Timeline - this element shows his career in a chronological experience. Reading from the top (when he started his career) to the bottom (when he finishes his career). This section tells you which clubs he has managed and a summary of what he achieved.
- Club logos - These images add a visual to UI and improving UX as it's not just text on the page.

### Testimonials page:
- Card style view - this gives the user an easy to read card view that breaks information down into small sections. The user can read from card to card.
- Card images - all images are of the same size, giving the UI consistency. This also gives the context of who the quote was from.
- Card quotes - short quotes about Sir Alex admiring him. These quotes are from players who played under him and other managers giving credit.

### Gallery page:
- Collage images - these images are placed in a collage design. This allows me to place multiple sized images to the given screen size. The images show the success and happiness he had in the game.

### Contact page:
- Contact form - this gives the user the ability to message me for any issues they are having with the site, any suggestions of improvement and to give their opinions on any other manager that could potentially take his place.

# 4. Testing
  [Go to the top](#table-of-contents)

## Automated testing
### Google Developer Tools

For every element that I added to my HTML, I would add the basic CSS to my stylesheet. I would then use the inspect element to try different styles. Once I've got it to my liking I would copy the CSS from google into my stylesheet. This allows me to keep track of the code I am using.

### Responsive Tools

I used [Am I Responsive](http://ami.responsivedesign.is/) to make sure that all my pages are responsive to all devices.

### W3C Validator Tools

I used [W3C Markup](https://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_input+with_options) to check for any errors within my HTML pages.

I had an error on the index.html page with the iframe attribute of "frameborder". The HTML checker notified me that this attribute is obsolete and to use CSS instead.

I also had an error on the contact_us.html page with a duplicate ID of "form_inline". I rectified this by changing the ID's to a class instead and updated the CSS for this.

I used [W3C CSS Validation](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) to check for any error within my CSS stylesheet.

## Manual Testing

I have tested my site on Safari and google chrome on multiple devices.
I also used [JS Fiddle](https://jsfiddle.net/) as a playground to test all of my code before staging and committing any changes.

These include:
  - iPhone X
  - iPhone XS Max
  - iPad Pro
  - Macbook Pro

Please find below my testing process for all pages via mobile and web:

### All pages:
  - Navigation Bar:
    - Home - When selecting "home", the browser redirects me to the home page. The text in the navigation bar also stays highlighted in red. It worked as expected.

    - Text:
      - I checked that all text is in the correct and consistent size and font. I also checked that there were no typos.

    - Media:
      - I checked that all images and videos on this page load. Making sure that the video played and that all images have alt text if media does not load. It worked as expected.

    - Responsiveness
      - I checked that all pages and elements were responsive. Checking each page on mobile and website and adjusting screen size to find break points. It worked as expected.

# 5. Development Cycle
  [Go to the top](#table-of-contents)

There were many elements I changed, re-positioned and added from my original wireframes as they were more visually appealing.

### All pages:
 - Replaced the Sir Alex Photo on the top right with just a text. This is visually more appealing because the text can fit inside the navigation bar.

### Landing page:
  - The original wireframe lacked attention from users. I added an embedded YouTube video to make the user more variety with different media elements. This video is also a short introduction to what the website is about.

### Career page:
  - I added a statistics panel to show the numbers Sir Alex achieved during his career.
  - The original design shows the timeline is continuously on the left side of the page. I decided to change this to make the timeline appear on the centre of the page with the content displaying on the left then the right side of the page. This keeps the user engaged as the content isn't just a block of text.

### Testimonials page:
  - The original wireframe shows this page as an awards page with the same timeline design as the career page however, I changed this to a testimonials page. This is to give the user a better experience with a different format from the career page. As I was planning to use the same design the user would have been less engaged as they felt like they were reading the same content in the same format.
  - I added in a cards view, this gives the user smaller amounts of content so it's easy to process. The image on each card also gives the context of who the quote was from.

### Gallery page:
  - The gallery page has remained the same. I added a hover animation over each photo to give the context of what the image is about.

### Contact page:
 - After coding the contact page to the original design. I thought that it looked dull, so I added other elements to make this page visually appealing to the users.
 - Added google maps location
 - Added icons for location, telephone number and contact email.

# 6. Deployment
  [Go to the top](#table-of-contents)

I used GitHub pages to deploy my final project. To do this I had to:

1. Create a repository on GitHub.
2. Clone the repository on your chosen source code editor (Atom in my case) using the clone link.
4. Add files to Git (staging area) and use the atom commit to master button.
5. Use git within atom to push the code.
7. Go to GitHub and load your repository.
8. Select settings.
9. Select pages on the left menu bar.
10. Click on the master branch.
11. This will now generate a link with your website live.

# 8. Known Bugs
  [Go to the top](#table-of-contents)

  - On some mobile devices the navigation bar appears behind the content. This was rectified by adding a z-index to the CSS for the navigation bar.
  - My first implementation of the navigation bar was not responsive on mobile devices, meaning that the design was floating off the screen. This was rectified by implementing a new navbar that included a hamburger style button when the screen size gets smaller.
  - The form styling on some mobile devices do not match the web styles. This was rectified by adding WebKit appearance, appearance in the CSS and set the value to none.
  - The video on the home page was not responsive. This was fixed by adding a height value in the CSS in smaller media queries.
  - The managerial career stats section was also not responsive. This was fixed by adding a smaller font-size value to the media query of max-width 635px. This allowed the whole section to be visible on mobile devices.
